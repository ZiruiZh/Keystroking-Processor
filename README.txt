XML TO VIDEO - USER GUIDE

This program converts keystroke/typing data from XML, Data TXT, or IDFX files
into video animations that replay the typing process on a blank background.


INPUT AND OUTPUT

INPUT:
  XML/Word: XML files containing keyboard event data (e.g. from Microsoft Word
  typing activity), optionally paired with a .docx Word file for uniform
  typing mode.

  Data TXT: JSON-format data.txt files containing keyboard response events
  and timestamps (often from typing studies or research tools).

  IDFX: TypingDNA IDFX format files (XML-based) containing keyboard events
  with system key codes.

OUTPUT:
  MP4 video files (1280x720 resolution, 20 fps)
  Videos show text appearing character-by-character with a blinking caret
  Output is saved as MP4 files

OUTPUT LOCATION:
  The output files are stored in a folder generated upon the first process.
  The folder is created in the same directory as the program (main.py) and
  is named: xml-to-text-video-output

  Single file processing: The video is saved directly in this folder.
  Batch processing (2+ files): A timestamped subfolder is created inside
  xml-to-text-video-output, e.g. BATCH UPLOAD 2025-02-03 14-30-45, and
  all batch outputs are placed inside it.

  Naming conventions:
  XML files become {filename}.mp4
  Data TXT files become {filename}_data.mp4
  IDFX files become {filename}_idfx.mp4

  Every generation also creates a CSV file with the exact settings used
  ({filename}_settings.csv). Use these to keep a record or load them later
  via "Load Settings from CSV" to save time when reusing the same setup.


HOW TO USE - STEP BY STEP

STEP 1: Choose Your File Type
  At the top of the window, select from the dropdown: XML/Word, Data TXT,
  or IDFX. The interface will switch to show the appropriate queue and options.

STEP 2: Add Files to the Queue
  Click "Add [type] to Queue"
  Select one or more input files
  For XML/Word: Each XML can optionally use a Word file; the last selected
  Word path applies to all XMLs in the queue unless you change it.
  Your queue is shown in the list below. Use "Clear Queue" to remove all.

STEP 3: Configure Settings (Optional)
  Adjust Text Settings, Moving Window, Uniform Typing Mode, and Video Timing
  as needed (see Settings Reference below).

STEP 4: Process
  Click "Process All [type] Files in Queue"
  Wait for the progress bar to complete
  A message will confirm when done and show the output folder path

STEP 5: Find Your Videos
  Open the xml-to-text-video-output folder (in the same folder as main.py).
  For batch runs, open the timestamped subfolder inside it.

TIP: Use "Save Settings" to save your preferences. They load automatically
on next startup. Use "Preview Video" (when a single file is set) to
preview without saving.


COMPLETE SETTINGS REFERENCE

TEXT SETTINGS

Font
  What it does: Chooses the font family (e.g. Arial, Times New Roman) used
  to render all text in the video.
  How to use: Select from the dropdown. Fonts are loaded from your system.

Font Size
  What it does: Sets the text size in pixels (default 30).
  How to use: Enter a number. Larger means bigger text.

Bold
  What it does: Renders text in bold when checked.
  How to use: Check or uncheck.

Margin
  What it does: Adds padding (in pixels) around the text from the edges of
  the frame (default 20).
  How to use: Enter a number. Higher means more space around text.

Show Caret
  What it does: When checked, displays a blinking cursor at the end of the
  typed text. When unchecked, no cursor is shown.
  How to use: Check to show cursor, uncheck to hide it.


MOVING WINDOW

Enable Moving Window
  What it does: Restricts the visible area to a small window of text that
  follows the caret. Text outside the window is replaced by mask characters.
  How to use: Check to enable. When enabled, the options below become active.

Window Size (chars)
  What it does: Controls how many characters are visible at once. The actual
  visible window is about twice this value (e.g. 10 gives about 20 chars).
  How to use: Enter a number (default 10).

Window Only Current Word
  What it does: (When Moving Window is on) Further restricts the view to
  only the current word being typed.
  How to use: Check to enable.

Mask (narrow)
  What it does: Character used to hide narrow/standard-width characters
  (e.g. i, l, 1) when they fall outside the visible window.
  How to use: Enter a single character (default: _).

Mask (wide)
  What it does: Character used to hide wider characters (e.g. m, M, W, @)
  when they fall outside the visible window. Keeps spacing consistent.
  How to use: Enter a single character (default: #).


UNIFORM TYPING MODE

Uniform Typing Speed (use Word file as reference)
  What it does: Ignores original keystroke timestamps and types at a fixed
  speed based on the full text from a Word (.docx) file. Useful when you
  want consistent speed regardless of actual typing rhythm.
  How to use: Check to enable. Requires a Word file (for XML/Word mode).
  When enabled, the options below become active.

Characters per Second
  What it does: Typing speed when Uniform Typing is on (default 10).
  How to use: Enter a decimal (e.g. 8.5 = 8.5 characters per second).

Video Speed Multiplier
  What it does: Scales the entire video playback speed. 1.0 = normal.
  2.0 = twice as fast, 0.5 = half speed.
  How to use: Enter a positive number (default 1.0).

Word Typing Speed (s/word)
  What it does: Duration (in seconds) for the first character of each new
  word. Creates a slight pause at the start of each word (default 0.15).
  How to use: Enter a decimal.

Space Duration (s)
  What it does: How long (in seconds) each space character is displayed
  (default 0.25).
  How to use: Enter a decimal.


VIDEO TIMING CONTROLS

Enable Video Timing Controls
  What it does: Lets you trim the video to a specific time range or
  percentage of the original.
  How to use: Check to enable. Options below become active.

Start Time (ms) / End Time (ms)
  What it does: (Absolute mode) Start and end of the output video in
  milliseconds. Only frames in this range are included.
  How to use: Enter milliseconds (e.g. 1000 = 1 second).

Duration (%)
  What it does: (Percentage mode) Percentage of the video to keep from
  the start time.
  How to use: Enter 1 to 100 (e.g. 50 = first half).

Absolute Time vs Percentage
  Absolute: Use Start/End times in milliseconds.
  Percentage: Use Start time plus Duration % of the remaining length.


OPTIONS

Save Video
  What it does: When checked, outputs MP4 files. Uncheck if you only want
  to preview (useful with Preview Video button).
  How to use: Check to save, uncheck to skip saving.

Preview Video
  What it does: Generates a temporary video and opens it in your default
  video player. Requires a single XML file to be set (XML/Word mode).
  How to use: Click to preview.

Save Settings
  What it does: Writes all current settings to xml-to-text-settings.json
  in the program folder. Settings load automatically on next launch.
  How to use: Click to save.

Load Settings from CSV
  What it does: Loads settings from a CSV file (created alongside each
  video output). Use to quickly reuse settings from a previous generation
  or keep a written record of how videos were made.
  How to use: Click and select a _settings.csv file.


BETTER WAYS TO USE THE PROGRAM

FONTS:
  Prefer MONOSPACE (fixed-width) fonts (e.g. Consolas, Courier New, Monaco)
  when using the Moving Window feature. With monospace fonts, all characters
  have the same width, so masking and spacing stay consistent and readable.
  For proportional fonts, the program uses separate narrow/wide mask
  characters to preserve layout; monospace still tends to look cleaner.

MASKING CHARACTERS:
  Choose mask characters that are easy to read and not distracting.
  Default _ (underscore) and # (hash) work well for most uses.
  Avoid using the same character as actual text (e.g. don't use "a" if
  your text contains many a's).
  Single characters only. Avoid symbols that might look like punctuation
  in your text.

TYPING SPEED:
  For natural-looking playback, keep Video Speed Multiplier between 0.5
  and 2.0 unless you need extreme slow/fast motion.
  Uniform Typing Mode is best when you have a clean Word file and want
  consistent speed; leave it off if you want to preserve original typing
  rhythm from the input data.

BATCH PROCESSING:
  Add all files to the queue before processing to avoid starting multiple
  batch runs.
  Batch runs with 2+ files create a timestamped subfolder so each run
  stays organized.

FILE FORMATS:
  Ensure XML files follow the expected structure (keyboard events with
  output and startTime).
  For large data.txt files, install ijson (pip install ijson) for efficient
  streaming parsing.


USEFUL POINTERS

  The output folder xml-to-text-video-output is created automatically
  when you run your first process. It appears in the same folder as main.py.

  Settings are stored in xml-to-text-settings.json in the program folder.
  You can edit this file manually if needed (use valid JSON).

  Each video output has a matching _settings.csv file with all settings used.
  Use "Load Settings from CSV" to reload those settings and save time, or
  keep the CSV files as written records of how each video was generated.

  Preview Video works only for XML/Word mode with a single XML file
  selected. Batch mode does not support preview.

  If a font cannot be loaded, the program falls back to a system default
  and may show a warning.

  Processing runs in the background. You can keep using the window, but
  avoid starting another process until the current one finishes.


BACKGROUND: HOW THE PROGRAM FUNCTIONS, PLUGINS, AND INSTALLATION

HOW THE PROGRAM WORKS
  The application reads keystroke data from input files and turns it into
  a video animation:

  1. PARSING: Reads the input file (XML, JSON data.txt, or IDFX) and extracts
  keyboard events: which key was pressed and when (timestamps).

  2. TEXT RECONSTRUCTION: Builds a sequence of text states (snapshots of
  the text after each keystroke). Handles space, backspace, and special
  keys. Optionally uses a Word file for uniform typing (ignores timestamps
  and types at fixed speed).

  3. FRAME GENERATION: For each text state, creates an image (1280x720) with
  text wrapped to fit the frame, optional moving window (masking text outside
  a visible region), blinking caret (optional), and font/size/margin applied.

  4. VIDEO ASSEMBLY: Converts the image sequence into an MP4 using frame
  durations from the timestamps. Applies speed multiplier and timing
  controls (trimming).

  Threading is used so long operations (parsing, frame generation, video
  encoding) run in the background without freezing the interface.


HOW THE PLUGINS/LIBRARIES ARE USED

  tkinter: Built-in GUI (windows, buttons, dropdowns, file dialogs).
  lxml (etree): Parses XML and IDFX files to extract keyboard events.
  python-docx (Document): Reads Word (.docx) files for uniform typing mode.
  Pillow (PIL): Creates images, draws text, loads fonts. Used for every
  frame of the video.
  moviepy (ImageSequenceClip): Assembles image frames into an MP4 video.
  ijson (optional): Streams through large JSON data.txt files without
  loading everything into memory.
  numpy (via moviepy): Converts images to arrays for video encoding.


HOW TO INSTALL AND CREATE A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
  A virtual environment isolates this project's dependencies from your
  system Python and other projects. Recommended.

  Step 1: Create a virtual environment
  In Terminal/Command Prompt, navigate to the program folder and run:
    python -m venv myenv
  (Replace "myenv" with any name you prefer, e.g. "venv".)

  Step 2: Activate the virtual environment
  On macOS/Linux:
    source myenv/bin/activate
  On Windows (Command Prompt):
    myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
  On Windows (PowerShell):
    myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  After activation, your prompt usually shows (myenv) or similar.

  Step 3: Install dependencies
  With the virtual environment active:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
  For full functionality (including large data.txt support):
    pip install ijson

  Step 4: Run the program
    python main.py

  To deactivate the virtual environment when finished:
    deactivate

  REQUIREMENTS (from requirements.txt):
  moviepy, Pillow, lxml, python-docx

  RECOMMENDED ADDITIONAL:
  ijson (for large data.txt files)

  Python 3.8 or newer is recommended.
